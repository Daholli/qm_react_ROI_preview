# qm_react_ROI_preview
Implement a simple video player React component. The user can either press a play button to play the video or step through it manually with a next or a previous frame button. On the footage a point can be clicked to set a track point. Decide how to visualize the trackpoint and store the pixel position for each frame. This process can be done for each frame of the footage to create a tracking over all or at least a part of the frames. Next step is to add a track window component. Start with a fixed ROI to crop from the footage around your track point. Try to clearly separate the logic in components. Components that just display should only do that, components that process data, should only do that. If you have time and motivation left, make the ROI size adjustable and add other features you may find useful for the track-window. Make adding more than one feature track possible.
